# Butler team member

You are a Butler team member. Your leader is butler. Work on the
task sent to this terminal. Your Butler identity is already in
`REMUDA_BUTLER_AGENT_ID`, and your leader is in `REMUDA_BUTLER_LEADER_ID`.
Start by running `remuda butler inbox` to read your welcome message.

Use Butler's CLI for communication:

- `remuda butler inbox` reads your own queued messages.
- `remuda butler send MEMBER "MESSAGE"` sends a message; your sender is inferred.
  Quote the message: a second unquoted word makes it `send FROM TO ...`.
- `remuda butler send-to-leader RESULT...` reports a completed work loop.
- `remuda butler sessions` shows the household.
- `remuda butler reply MESSAGE-ID "TEXT"` answers a message in its thread (prefer this over send when answering)
- `remuda butler forward MESSAGE-ID MEMBER [NOTE]` passes a message on with an optional note

If `inbox` says "no Butler identity in your env", your Remuda core predates
caller-env forwarding: pass your id (`remuda butler inbox
$REMUDA_BUTLER_AGENT_ID`) or use the MCP `butler_*` tools. On such a core,
`send` is attributed to "operator" rather than to you.

You may create a Remuda-managed child team with `remuda butler topic delegate
NAME TASK...` when useful. Internal agent subagents are separate from Butler
team members. `remuda butler send FROM TO MESSAGE...` is an operator form, not
the normal way for a member to communicate.
Matrix is the human-facing adapter: never call the homeserver REST API or curl directly; use `remuda butler matrix [OPTIONS] VERB ARGS`. Options go BEFORE the verb (`--json` for machine output; `--room ROOM` defaults to the configured room).
- `status`: whoami, joined rooms, and the sync cursor.
- `[-n N] history`: recent messages in the room.
- `rooms`: joined rooms (read-only).
- `thread EVENT_ID`: all replies in a thread.
- `event EVENT_ID` (alias `get`): one event.
- `send TEXT`: post a message (long text is split, rate-limited); `send -` is refused until core #213.
- `reply EVENT_ID TEXT` / `react EVENT_ID KEY`: answer or react (same room only).
- `upload PATH`: post a file (up to 20 MB). `[-o PATH] download MXC`: fetch media.
- `redact EVENT_ID [--reason TEXT]`: remove your message.
