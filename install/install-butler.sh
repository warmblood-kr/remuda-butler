# Installs a persistence layer for `remuda exec butler`: a systemd --user
# timer (Linux) or a launchd agent (macOS) that polls `remuda ls` every 15s
# and re-runs `remuda exec butler` whenever no session is named exactly
# "butler" -- reviving the Matrix bridge after a daemon crash, `remuda
# restart`, or a reboot, none of which anything in `remuda` itself recovers
# from on its own (native/tests/daemon.rs,
# a_daemon_restart_does_not_relaunch_the_butler_session).

#   REMUDA_BUTLER_CONFIG_FILE=<path>  default: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/remuda/butler/config
#
# This script only ever CONSUMES a token/config file placed there by some
# other means -- obtaining a Matrix access token is out of scope here, and
# this script never writes secret content anywhere.
#
# `remuda exec butler` is a one-shot registration call, not a long-running
# process (it returns as soon as the package is registered in the daemon's
# image -- see native/src/bin/remuda.rs's exec_command) -- so the persistence
# layer here is poll-and-relaunch, not Restart=on-failure/KeepAlive: wrapping
# a call that always exits 0 in either would just relaunch it in a tight loop
# without ever noticing the daemon underneath had died.
#
# Windows has no systemd/launchd equivalent wired up here yet: run `remuda
# exec butler` by hand after a restart, or via Task Scheduler, until someone
# builds that lane.
#
# The reboot leg is unproven, by construction: the daemon-restart/relaunch
# logic below was verified for real (`restart -f`, a genuine registration,
# a kill, a by-hand relaunch matching the poll loop), but never across an
# actual `reboot` -- this was developed on the shared fleet substrate, where
# rebooting would kill every concurrent session on it. Whether OnBootSec=10s
# actually fires after a real reboot, and whether `loginctl enable-linger`
# actually keeps the --user instance alive through a real logout/reboot
# cycle, needs a machine a human can reboot on purpose. Open limitation, not
# a verified claim.
#
# Ceiling, recorded not fixed: `init.lua` no longer depends on the daemon's
# birth environment for the token/config *paths* (this script's own copy step
# below plus init.lua's conventional-path default is what makes that true),
# but every OTHER environment variable the daemon's Lua image reads via
# `os.getenv` still has that same birth-environment property -- fixed forever
# at whichever moment first auto-started the daemon, never re-read per
# client/request. That's a `remuda`-architecture-level question, not this
# feature's to solve; naming it here so it isn't rediscovered as a surprise.
#
# This script also writes $config_home/remuda/init.lua (sibling to
# remuda/butler/, not inside it) -- native/src/daemon.rs's `load_user_config`
# evaluates that file automatically, once, every time a FRESH daemon boots
# (mirroring how Neovim/Hammerspoon/WezTerm auto-load a user init file). That
# makes the poller (`butler-poll.sh` below) redundant for the *daemon-restart*
# scenario specifically -- butler is back the instant the next command
# lazily starts a fresh daemon, not up to 15s later. The timer/agent itself
# is still necessary for two other reasons the loader does not cover: (1)
# nothing else causes a daemon to exist at all after a reboot -- the loader
# only ever runs as *part of* a daemon boot, it cannot trigger one -- and (2)
# it remains a safety net if the loader itself ever fails (a typo, a stale
# binary). An older remuda binary (built before the loader existed) silently
# ignores $config_home/remuda/init.lua, exactly as if it were absent -- a
# fact to know, not a trap to design around.
